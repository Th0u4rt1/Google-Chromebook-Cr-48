A _NOSTALGIC_ computer from my childhood. Only my current Asus Chromebook exceeds this!

## Specs Compared

|Spec|Cr-48|C424M|
|---|---|---|
|SoC|Intel Atom N455|M1 Max|
|SoC Speed|1.66 GHz|2.8 GHz|
|RAM|2GB|4GB|
|Disk Space|16GB|128GB|

As the stats can attest to, my current Chromebook can't hold a candle to its trusty OG counterpart.
And the latter's still stylish as it looks and performs! üòçüòçüòç
